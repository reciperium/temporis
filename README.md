## Installation

```sh
nix profile install github:reciperium/temporis
```

## Why?

A pomodoro application can help you switch between focus mode, where you can explore a single idea in depth, and diffusion mode,
where you can let your mind wonder around, and subconsciously explore other ideas, avoiding the [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect).
Furthermore, clear breaks give you space to stretch, move and hydrate.

The app tries to consolidate nice features from different pomodoro apps, into a single one, with the style of
the host operating system.

Reciperium builds applications for the mind and soul.
